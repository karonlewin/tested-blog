While developing the first feature of the blog, I started to use the test framework trying to build the blog from outside to inside.

So after whatching the 15 min video from RailCast I can figure out better how to apply those things that I learn reading the book.

ps>: explain everything about the motivation to read the book.

### Example begin ###

Failures:

  1) ReadingPosts show posts list when access the index page
     Failure/Error: visit root_path

     ActionView::MissingTemplate:
       Missing template home/index, application/index with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :jbuilder, :coffee]}. Searched in:
         * "/home/karon/Rubik/tested-blog/app/views"


Finished in 0.17596 seconds (files took 1.27 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/features/reading_posts_spec.rb:5 # ReadingPosts show posts list when access the index page


### Example end ###

After adding in app/views/application the index.html.erb page, the guard shows:

### Example begin ###

Finished in 0.8359 seconds (files took 1.26 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures

### Example end ###


After adding a should have "Posts" the guard gave me this:

Failures:

  1) ReadingPosts show posts list when access the index page
     Failure/Error: page.should have_content('Posts')
       expected to find text "Posts" in ""
     # ./spec/features/reading_posts_spec.rb:7:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'


After adding Posts simple string to index.html.erb everything it's fine.
