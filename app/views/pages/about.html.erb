      <p>
        The main idea contained in this blog is to approach, in many ways, Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
        and Ruby on Rails while building something real.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2016 I started to learn Ruby through an online course and I moved on to learn about the Ruby on Rails framework too.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I felt in love with this world and I started looking more about the Rails way of
        developing and I realized that TDD and BDD is naturally attached with all that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I started to get to know more about the red-green-refactor cycle and BDD practices through books
        and online courses, but I didnâ€™t want just to reproduce what they are doing. I really want to practice it in a true scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my goal is to keep improving the blog with new features and posts, always practicing the red-green-refactor
        cycle and writing about this new experience.
